# KhaledandMostafa Organization

We are two friends collaborating to learn and grow in web development. Our goal is to gain hands-on experience and apply what we learn along the way. 

The code we share here isn’t polished or perfectly structured—it’s functional and reflects our journey of getting our hands dirty and experimenting with ideas.
